This project is written in python and its supposed to help transform data which is provided when you open and the instructions provided in the PDF.
We first input the Data in Excel and save it as a CSV document.
We open python in whichever environment I used Visual Studio then in the instruction we have code and queries which I used to transform the DOC.
The solution in this project was to observe the errors in the document and correct them if possible.
